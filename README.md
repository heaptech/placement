# Placement:

Placement is an application to manage your teams and resources efficiently from one place. The idea of Placement is to keep track of all of the resources within the organization, including the teams in which they are/were and the projects which they are working on (and worked on previously) and their skills. 
Placement is a RBAC system and users will be added through via invites. 

## Technologies Used:
Placement is being built using Django.

# Future Goals:
- Define the hourly/monthly rates of your team members and then generate the invoices for the clients directly. 
- Clients access, to verify which resource is working on which project, and existing clients can directly ask for more clients based on resource availability. etc. 
- Automatic Job description generation, once a resource leaves the company. Using the skillset that they had, we can generate a nicely formatted Job Description to backfill that position, using AI.
